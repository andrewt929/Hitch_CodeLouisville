# Instructions
*NOTE* BEFORE YOU LOAD!!!!
If you are downloading these files as a .zip with the intent to run them from your desktop, you will need to allow Cross Origin Requests (CORS)
This is because the site references a video housed on DropBox.
A chrome extension which will let you do this easily is: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en

After downloading the files, if CORS is enabled in the browswer (see *NOTE*), then simply click on "index.html".
Alternatively you can view it at Hitch.click
